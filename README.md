### Hi, I'm Ollie 👋🏼
#### I'm a PhD student at The University of Manchester researching open quantum systems. I'm currently looking at tensor network methods.


🥼 I have researched quantum synchronisation of qubits on the IBM quantum experience for my Masters project. 

🥼 I simulated the dynamics of a quantum phase gate via coupled Rydberg atoms [simple quantum gate](https://github.com/OliverDudgeon/QuantumGates) for my 3rd year physics project.

I work on the front-end of scientific web apps for [Informatics Matters](https://github.com/InformaticsMatters/) including:

- 📈 [data-manager-ui](https://github.com/InformaticsMatters/mini-apps-data-tier-ui) 
- 🧪 [Fragnet Search](https://squonk.it/fragnet-search-ui) - Search a database of molecular fragments based on a search molecule . View and compare different fragments then find where you can purchase them 🛒.
