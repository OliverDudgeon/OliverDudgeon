### Hi, I'm Ollie
#### I'm a Theoretical Physics PhD student at The University of Manchester researching open quantum systems. I'm currently looking at tensor network methods. I additionally work on web based solutions for computational biochemistry with [Informatics Matters Ltd](https://github.com/InformaticsMatters)
