### Hi, I'm Ollie 👋🏼
#### I'm a 4th year Physics student at the University of Nottingham, UK

🥼 I simulated the physics of a [simple quantum gate](https://github.com/OliverDudgeon/QuantumGates) for my 3rd year physics project.

I work on the front-end of scientific web apps for [Informatics Matters](https://github.com/InformaticsMatters/) including:

- 🧪 [Fragnet Search](fragnet.informaticsmatters.com/) - Search a database of molecular fragments based on a search molecule . View and compare different fragments then find where you can purchase them 🛒.
- [react-sci-components](https://github.com/InformaticsMatters/react-sci-components/)
